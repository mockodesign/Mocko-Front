# Canzat Images

This directory contains image files that will be displayed in the Canzat list.

## File Requirements:
- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .svg, .webp
- Files should be named descriptively (e.g., "business-card.jpg", "social-media-post.png")
- All images are automatically marked as premium
- Images will be used as both thumbnails and as base designs for the editor

## How it works:
1. Add image files to this directory
2. The API will automatically detect them and create Canzat items
3. When a user selects a Canzat, the image will be loaded into the editor as a base design
4. Users can then edit and customize the design

## Examples:
- business-card.jpg
- presentation-slide.png
- social-media-post.jpg
- web-banner.png
